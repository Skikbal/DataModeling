# 🧱 Structuring the Database: Normalization vs Denormalization

### 🔄 **Normalization**

* **Goal:**

  * Reduce **data redundancy** (no unnecessary copies of data)
  * Improve **data integrity** (ensure the data is correct and consistent)

* **Feels Natural:**

  * Keeps data organized, efficient, and logically separated

* **Example:**

  * Store an artist’s name only once in an "Artists" table instead of repeating it in every song record

* **Definition:**

  * A process of organizing tables and columns following **normal forms** (rules) to reduce redundancy and enforce integrity

* **Origin:**

  * Proposed by **Edgar Codd**, father of the relational model

---

### 📈 **Denormalization**

* **Goal:**

  * Improve **performance** in **read-heavy** workloads
* **Feels Unnatural (but necessary):**

  * Involves **duplicating data** for faster access
* **When to Use:**

  * When queries are complex or too slow because of many joins
* **Trade-off:**

  * You gain speed, but risk **inconsistencies** and more maintenance

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

* **Normalization** = Clean structure, fewer updates, more joins
* **Denormalization** = Faster reads, less joins, more data duplication
* Start **normalized**, then selectively **denormalize** for performance if needed

Here’s a clear **summary of the objectives of normalization** in relational databases:

---

## ✅ **Objectives of Normalization**

1. ### 🔄 **Eliminate Unwanted Insert, Update & Delete Anomalies**

   * **Goal:** Ensure data is updated in **one place**, not multiple
   * **Why:** Reduces errors and inconsistencies
   * **Example:** Change a customer’s phone number in one table, not dozens

2. ### 🔧 **Minimize Refactoring When Adding New Data Types**

   * **Goal:** Allow for **easy schema changes** as business needs evolve
   * **Why:** A normalized structure lets you add a **new table or column** without disrupting existing data or apps
   * **Example:** Add customer emails without rewriting the entire schema

3. ### 📖 **Make the Data Model Intuitive for Users**

   * **Goal:** Ensure the model reflects **real-world concepts** clearly
   * **Why:** Like clean code, a well-modeled schema is **easy to understand and use**
   * **Example:** A “Customer” table clearly reflects what a customer *is*

4. ### 🧮 **Make the Model Independent of Specific Queries**

   * **Goal:** Don’t build your schema just to support specific queries
   * **Why:** A normalized model supports **future flexibility**
   * **Note:** This is **opposite** of NoSQL modeling, which is designed around query patterns

Here's a **clear summary of the normalization process and the three main normal forms** used in relational database design:

---

## 🔄 **Normalization Process Overview**

Normalization is a **step-by-step process** to organize data in a relational database to:

* **Eliminate redundancy** (no unnecessary duplicates)
* **Improve data integrity** (ensure data accuracy)

Each form builds on the last:

* You must satisfy **1NF** before moving to **2NF**
* You must satisfy **2NF** before moving to **3NF**

Most databases stop at **Third Normal Form (3NF)** — forms beyond this are rarely used in practice.

---

### ✅ **1st Normal Form (1NF):**

**Goal:** Ensure atomic (indivisible) data in each field
**Requirements:**

* Each column contains **only one value** (no lists, sets, or arrays)
* Table should have a **primary key**
* Remove **repeating groups** or nested data
* Separate related data into **logical tables**

🔑 **Key Principle:** Every field must hold a **single, atomic value**

**Example:**
Bad: `Genres: Rock, Pop, Jazz`
Good: Each genre should be in a **separate row or table**

---

### ✅ **2nd Normal Form (2NF):**

**Goal:** Eliminate **partial dependencies** on composite keys
**Requirements:**

* Must be in **1NF**
* Every column must depend on the **whole primary key**, not just part of it

🔑 **Key Principle:** All non-key attributes must depend on the **entire primary key**, not a part of it

**Example:**
If a table uses `(StoreID, CustomerID)` as a composite key, but `CustomerEmail` only depends on `CustomerID`, split that into a separate table.

---

### ✅ **3rd Normal Form (3NF):**

**Goal:** Eliminate **transitive dependencies**
**Requirements:**

* Must be in **2NF**
* **Non-key columns must not depend on other non-key columns**

🔑 **Key Principle:** No column should depend on **another non-key column**

**Example:**
If `BandName → LeadSinger`, and you already have `AwardWinner = BandName`, then `LeadSinger` is **transitively dependent**. Move `LeadSinger` to a separate table to avoid duplication.

---

## ✅ **Why Normalize?**

* 🔄 Avoid repeated data
* ✅ Ensure consistency (only update in one place)
* 🧩 Easier to modify structure over time
* 🔍 Keeps your data accurate and meaningful
